## What can I do ? (Open Tasks)

### Improve the Main View for future content

The Main view is currently very basic. Here are a list of ideas to improve it : 

- Prepare labels for future content
- Reposition relevant informations in the bottom border
- Reposition the ProgressBar & TextureRect in the middle part
- Prepare capture & gender icon on the top border
